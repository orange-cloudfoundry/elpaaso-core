- refactor MultiProfileProjectionServiceDispatcherImpl to use ProjectionService interface instead of impl directly
    - check previous usage of generateNewDeployment(ApplicationRelease applicationRelease, DeploymentProfileEnum profile,
                              //            long currentTimeMillis) {}
                              used to simulate time
        => Only used for VHM tests which are not relevant anymore:
            - Unique hostname Id should be made in Iaas plugin rather than projection
            - VHM VCD support is deprecated
    remove VcdBaseProjectionServiceTest.testHostnamesUniqueAcrossProjectionsForVHM()

    remove timestam param DeploymentMap
    Change BaseProjectionServiceImpl.platformServerFactory() to ignore the timestamp
    PlatformServer.generatePlatformServerHostName(hostnamePrefix, platformServerIndex)

    Refine the Technical Model to distinguish between two concepts:
    1- operating system-level hostname
    2- IaaS computer name

    + Need clarification over the human-readeable hostname prefix to be assigned by the projection, and actual value
    assigned at runtime (no javadoc in PlatformServer.hostname or getters/setters)



    Currently, only #1 is modeled and persistent in JPA, while #2 is transient and dynamically generated into IaasImpl.createComposeParams()

        			// The Hostname set by the projection is only a prefix at this
        			// stage.
        			// Here, we generate a unique hostname and keep association between
        			// original hostname and generated hostname
        			// Hostname will be updated in TDI.TD (not in TDI.TDT.TD)
        			String newHostname = ((Long) System.currentTimeMillis()).toString();
        			int maxSizeForUIDsuffix = getMaxHostnameLength() - vm.getHostName().length() - 1;
        			newHostname = vm.getHostName() + "-" + newHostname.substring(newHostname.length() - maxSizeForUIDsuffix);
        			vmNamesMap.put(vm.getHostName(), newHostname);
        			vm.setHostName(vmNamesMap.get(vm.getHostName()));



- extract more Strategy interfaces and classes: LogicalRelationalDb, OnlineStorage, moving some generic assertions there
e.g. assertDbaasSubscriptions() calling assertDbaasSubscriptionMatchingRelationalService()

check etc/hosts is not updated anymore by IaasImpl.updateEtcHosts
