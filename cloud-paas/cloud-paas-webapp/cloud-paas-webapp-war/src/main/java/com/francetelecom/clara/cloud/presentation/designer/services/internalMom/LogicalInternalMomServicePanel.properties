portal.designer.service.mom.title               = Internal MOM Service
portal.designer.service.mom.description.0       = Provides ability to send and receive asynchronous messages that are consumed within the same application.
portal.designer.service.mom.description.1       = JMS API version 1.1 is supported with XA transaction support.
portal.designer.service.mom.description.2       = Limitations with regard to JMS API:
portal.designer.service.mom.description.3       =  - JMS ReplyTo field is not supported
portal.designer.service.mom.description.4       =  - Only queues are supported (topic are planned for future)

portal.designer.service.mom.main.letter     = main destination
# functional
portal.designer.service.mom.ml.label = label
portal.designer.service.mom.ml.destinationName         = JNDI queue name
portal.designer.service.mom.ml.jmsConnectionFactoryJndiName      = ConnectionFactory JNDI name

# Help tooltip for functional main destination
portal.designer.service.mom.ml.destinationName.help         = JNDI name under which the Destination will be available. Should be unique within all Internal Queues connected to a given architecture.
portal.designer.service.mom.ml.jmsConnectionFactoryJndiName.help      = JNDI name under which the ConnectionFactory will be available. This factory supports XA transactions, and therefore may be involved into a transaction with RDB service. The JTA transaction manager is available in the JNDI in the default well-known location. Currently, a single default instance is available named "CF".

# Non Functional
portal.designer.service.mom.nonfunctional = non functional attributes
portal.designer.service.mom.ml.msgMaxSizeKB      = max message size (kB)
portal.designer.service.mom.ml.destinationCapacity     = destination capacity (nb msg)
portal.designer.service.mom.ml.persistentMessagesUsed = persistent messages used
portal.designer.service.mom.ml.highAvailability         = high availability

# Help tooltip for non functional main destination
portal.designer.service.mom.ml.msgMaxSizeKB.help      = Should be smaller than 10 MB. This is measured as the number of bytes of serialized Java message object. This information is used to size the message persistence storage.
portal.designer.service.mom.ml.destinationCapacity.help     = Max number of message to be persisted in the queue when the receiver is not consuming messages. This should include messages sent by all execution nodes using the MOM Service. Note that the queue may enforce this max number of messages. When this maximum capacity is reached, the next message sending will be rejected. A large capacity can be rejected if insufficient persistent storage is available to guarantee this SLO.
portal.designer.service.mom.ml.highAvailability.help         = In the future, enables to provisioning HA for queues.

# Dead Letter
portal.designer.service.mom.dead.letter = dead letter queue
portal.designer.service.mom.dl.hasDeadLetterQueue   = enable dead letter queue
portal.designer.service.mom.dl.deadLetterQueueName     = JNDI dead letter queue name
portal.designer.service.mom.dl.deadLetterQueueCapacity = dead letter queue capacity
portal.designer.service.mom.dl.retriesBeforeMovingToDeadLetterQueue  = redeliveries before deadqueue

# Help tooltips for dead letter
portal.designer.service.mom.dl.hasDeadLetterQueue.help   = Check to enable a dead letter queue. A dead letter queue is the queue to which messages are sent if they cannot be delivered properly.
portal.designer.service.mom.dl.deadLetterQueueName.help     = JNDI name under which the dead letter queue instance will be available. A similar dead letter queue can be shared by several queues.
portal.designer.service.mom.dl.deadLetterQueueCapacity.help = Hint to the PaaS for the sizing of the dead letter queue. Max number of messages to be hold in the queue. When this capacity is exceeded, unprocessed messages are lost (app-ops may check logs for such occurrences)
portal.designer.service.mom.dl.retriesBeforeMovingToDeadLetterQueue.help  = On message reception error (e.g. a transaction rollback while processing the message, or an exception thrown), the max number of times the message will be sent to the receiver before being redirected to dead letter queue.
