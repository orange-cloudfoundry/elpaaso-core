Notes taken during the TDD training session on test smells for the class LogicalModelItemAnnotationsTest

Test Smells:

- mystery guest: spring context

- obscure test:
    tests spring context,
    exploration test (anotation ds jdk)
    current values in service catalog
    commentaires

Next refactorings to fix code Smells:
- calls to introspectedClass.getAnnotation() should be moved to LogicalServicesHelper.isExternal(LogicalService)
- LogicalServicesHelper should be moved from webapp to logicalmodel
- replace LogicalModelItemAnnotationsTest with tests of clara-paas-aggregate\cloud-orange-paas\cloud-paas\cloud-paas-webapp\cloud-paas-webapp-war\src\main\java\com\francetelecom\clara\cloud\presentation\designer\support\LogicalServicesHelper.java
