   This file contains a catalog of sample logical model. It is used both by automated tests and by
        the UI to propose inspection and reuse of those models

   Warning: as some of the automated tests rely on the bean name to select one of the sample, make sure
        to update the test (e.g. ProjectionServiceTest when changing bean names)
